# Composing music with <br />composed functions
### Adam Giese (@AdamGieseDev)

```notes
Give a brief introduction

- Welcome to '____'
- My name is Adam Giese (AdamGieseDev on twitter)
- Before software engineer, attended school for music
- Drawn to the "analytical thinking" aspect of music theory
- When started FP, found same itch scratched
- When started musical project, decided FP

"So, here is my introduction to functional programming — from a musical perspective."
```

---
<Intro />

## What is functional programming?

<Appear>
  Programming with functions!
</Appear>

```notes
- What is functional programming?

- (short pause -- click through)

- It's programming with functions!
- Object oriented based around objects
- 'Functions' are the building block

```

---
<Intro/>

## What is a function?
<Drake
  top1={'A sequence of commands'}
  top2={'abstracted into a reusable unit.'}
  bottom1={'A relationship between a'}
  bottom2={'set of inputs and outputs.'}
/>

```notes
- A non-functional definition might be something like...

- A more functional definition would be...

This definition is sometimes referred to as a "pure function"

- the mathematical definition of a function
- these "pure" functions are the building block.
```

---
<Intro/>

### What makes a function pure?
<Appear>
  <div>1. Given the same arguments, it will return the same value.</div>
  <div>2. No side effects.</div>
  <div><hr />This makes a function "referentially transparent."</div>
</Appear>

```notes
1. This means it shouln't rely on something outside that could be different, such as
  - Random number generators
  - The current time
  - Read from a database

2. This means it shouldn't effect anything outside of its return value:
  - Play music
  - Manipulate the DOM
  - Write to a database

"referentially transparent" means the expression can be replaced by its value
```

## Side effects are *NOT* bad. They include:
- Making an HTTP request
- DOM manipulation
- Printing to the console
- Playing music

```notes
- Side effects aren't bad, but they are unpredictable and harder to test

- Use your "impure" functions carefully and predicably
```

# Immutability
<Small>definition: a variable whose state cannot be modified after creation</Small>

```notes
Now that we have a definition of "functional programming" and "functions", lets take a look at some of the core concepts.

One of these is Immutability.
```
---
<Tools />
<Image src={butWhy} size='60vw' />

```notes
It might seem like immutability is tieing one arm behind your back

- There is a reason for this

```
---
<Tools />

## Advantages of Immutability

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Less for your brain to track</li>
    <li>Prevents unintentional side effects</li>
    <li>Preserves state</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
- Humans have a "working memory" -- that biological equivalent to RAM.

- Accidently changing a variable in a function can be a hard bug to track down

- Bank account: Not just a single balance:
  - Starting balance
  - Withdrawals and deposits

```

# Higher order functions

<Small>definition: a function that either accepts a function <br />as an argument or returns a function</Small>

```notes
Another technique of functional programming is "higher order functions"

"You might be thinking something along the lines of..."
```

# Dealing with arrays

```notes
- Manipulating arrays is an important part of all paradigms

- JavaScript comes with some Array methods that work well with FP

- Two concepts that we already covered that are important:
  -- Higher order functions: each of these methods _accept_ a function
  -- Immutability: each of the MENTIONED methods return a new array
```
---
<Tools />

## `Array.filter`
- Accepts a function run again every element
- <code>fn(element, index, array)</code>
- Returns a subset of the original array
---
<Tools />

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/filter.js")}
  lang="javascript"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={true}
  steps={[
      {},
      { range: [2,5], notes: "First, define the melody" },
      { range: [6,7], notes: "`isHigh` compares a notes frequency to middle C" },
      { range: [6,7], notes: "If the provided note is 'C4' or above it will return true" },
      { range: [9,9], notes: "`.filter` accepts a function as its argument" },
      { range: [10,10], notes: "Any values that return a 'truthy' value will remain" },
  ]}
/>
---
<Tools />

<Filters />

---
<Tools />

## `Array.map`
- Accepts a function run again every element
- <code>fn(element, index, array)</code>
- Returns array of same length with new values
---
<Tools />

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/map.js")}
  lang="javascript"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={true}
  steps={[
      {},
      { range: [9,9], notes: "This function takes a 'note' object and returns one with an incremented octave" },
      { range: [11,11], notes: "The `.map` method accepts a function that is applied to each array element" },
      { range: [13,18], notes: "In the new array, each note's octave has been incremented" },
  ]}
/>
---
<Tools />

<Map />

---
<Tools />

## `Array.reduce`
- Accepts a function run against every element
- <code>fn(accumulator, element, index, array)</code>
- Returns an 'accumulated' value
- Also known as 'fold' and 'accumulate'
- More generic than 'filter' and 'map'

```notes
- I often here that `.reduce` takes an array and returns a single value
- While this is true, it isn't super useful (since ALL functions return a single value)
- It is a very generic utility function that can return any type
```

      { tokens: {19: [8]}, notes: "`total` is the accumulator..." },
      { tokens: {19: [10]}, notes: "...`note` is the array element" },
      { range: [22,22], notes: "The method accepts a function and an initial value" },
      { range: [23,23], notes: "The return value is the end 'accumulation'" },
      { range: [4,4], notes: "Starting with the initial value of 0..." },
      { range: [4,4], notes: "...each notes length is added to the total." },
      { range: [4,4], notes: "0 + 0.125" },
      { range: [5,5], notes: "0.125 + 0.125 = 0.25" },
      { range: [6,6], notes: "0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375" },

### Partial Application
<Small>definition: a technique to "pre-set" or "fix"<br /> some arguments of a function</Small>

```notes
- incredibly useful for writing reusable, generic functions
- the term comes from "partially applying" the arguments to the function

- In the proposed partial application, you can use the '?' token as a placeholder
```
