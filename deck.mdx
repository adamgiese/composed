# Composing music with <br />composed functions
### Adam Giese (@AdamGieseDev)

```notes
Give a brief introduction

- Welcome to '____'
- My name is Adam Giese
- Software engineer full time for five years
- Before that, attended school for music
- Drawn to music theory -- analytical thinking
- When started FP, found same itch scratched
- When started musical project, decided FP

"So, here is my introduction to functional programming â€” from a musical perspective."
```

---

## What is functional programming?

<Appear>
  Programming with functions!
</Appear>

```notes
- What is functional programming?

- (short pause -- click through)

- It's programming with functions!

- Object oriented based around objects

- 'Functions' are the building block
```

---

## What is a function?
<Drake
  top1={'A sequence of commands'}
  top2={'abstracted into a reusable unit.'}
  bottom1={'A relationship between a'}
  bottom2={'set of inputs and outputs.'}
/>

---

### 'Pure' functions

<Appear>
  <div>1. Given the same arguments, it will return the same value.</div>
  <div>2. No side effects.</div>
  <div><hr />This makes a function "referentially transparent."</div>
</Appear>

```notes
- The ONLY thing you should care about is the return value
```
---

<Gru />

---

## Side effects are *NOT* bad. They include:
- Making an HTTP request
- DOM manipulation
- Printing to the console
- Playing music

# Immutability
<Small>definition: a variable whose state cannot be modified after creation</Small>
---
<Image src={butWhy} size='60vw' />
---

## Immutability preserves state

> "If you have a dollar, and I give you another dollar, it does not change the fact that a moment ago you only had one dollar, and now you have two."
_-Eric Elliott_

```notes
- Data is preserved.
- Think about a bank account?
- Redux architecture
- Musical score
- Philisophically, think about TIME itself
```
---
## Easier to reason about
- Prevents unintentional side effects
- No need to keep track of changes
- Declarative
---

## Math is immutable
```js
let x = 10;
x = x + 1;       // nonsense
const y = x + 1; // much better
```

---

# Higher order functions

<Small>definition: a function that either accepts a function <br />as an argument or returns a new function</Small>

  line1='Yo dawg I heard you like functions so I made a function'
  line2='that takes a function and returns a function'

# Dealing with arrays

```notes
- Manipulating arrays is an important part of all paradigms

- Two concepts that we already covered that are important:
  -- Higher order functions
  -- Immutability
```
---
## `[].filter`
- Accepts a function run again every element
- <code>predicate(element, index, array)</code>
- Returns a subset of the original array
---
<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/filter.js")}
  lang="javascript"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={true}
  steps={[
      {},
      { range: [1,1], notes: "Import Tone.js" },
      { range: [2,4], notes: "Define the melody" },
      { range: [6,6], notes: "`freq` converts from string ('A4') to number (440)" },
      { range: [7,7], notes: "`isHigh` is a 'predicate' (a function that returns a boolean)" },
      { range: [7,7], notes: "If the provided note is 'C4' or above it will return true" },
      { range: [9,9], notes: "`.filter` accepts a predicate as its argument" },
      { range: [10,10], notes: "Any values that pass the predicate remain" },
  ]}
/>
---

<Filters />

---
## `[].map`
- Accepts a function run again every element
- <code>fn(element, index, array)</code>
- Returns new array with manipulated values

---
<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/map.js")}
  lang="javascript"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={true}
  steps={[
      {},
      { range: [9,9], notes: "This function takes a 'note' object and returns one with an incremented octave" },
      { range: [11,11], notes: "The `.map` method accepts a function that is applied to each array element" },
      { range: [13,18], notes: "In the new array, each note's octave has been incremented" },
  ]}
/>
---

<Map />

---
## `[].reduce`
- Accepts a function run again every element
- <code>fn(accumulator, element, index, array)</code>
- Returns an 'accumulated' value
- Also known as 'fold' and 'accumulate'
- More generic than 'filter' and 'map'
---
<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/reduce.js")}
  lang="javascript"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={true}
  steps={[
      {},
      { range: [1,1], notes: "First, import Tone.js" },
      { range: [3,17], notes: "Define a melody with note names and length" },
      { range: [19,20], notes: "`toLength` is the function being passed to reduce" },
      { range: [19,20], notes: "It adds a notes length to a running total" },
      { range: [22,22], notes: "The method accepts a function and an initial value" },
      { range: [23,23], notes: "The return value is the end 'accumulation'" },
  ]}
/>

```notes
- I often here that `.reduce` takes an array and returns a single value
- While this is true, it isn't super useful (since ALL functions return a single value)
- It is a very generic utility function that can return any type
```
---

## Closure
<Small>definition: a function and its access to its enclosed state</Small>
---
### Partial Application
<Small>definition: a technique to "pre-set" some arguments of a function</Small>

```notes
- an application of closure
- incredibly useful for writing reusable, generic functions
```

      {},
      { range: [1,5], notes: "Closure allows an inner function to 'remember' its enclosing scope." },
      { range: [7,8], notes: "With ES6 arrow functions, you can write very concise examples of closure" },
      { range: [10,13], notes: "With partial application, you can set the array before the value" },
      { range: [15,18], notes: "" },
  ]}
/>
---

## Composition
<Small>definition: a technique to combine multiple functions into a new function</Small>

```notes
- I like the metaphor of "pipes"
```

      { range: [3,4], notes: "For example: an input of 'A4' would return 440" },

      { range: [6,7], notes: "For example: an input of 440 would return 444.4" },
      { range: [9,10], notes: "These are two similar functions" },
      { range: [9,9], notes: "`compose` takes two functions and calls from right to left" },
      { range: [9,9], notes: "This is the more 'mathematical' approach" },
      { range: [10,10], notes: "`pipe` takes two functions and calls from left to right" },
      { range: [12,13], notes: "`getDetunedFrequency` is the composition of these functions" },
