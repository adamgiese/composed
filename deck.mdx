# Composing music with <br />composed functions
### Adam Giese (@AdamGieseDev)

```notes
Give a brief introduction

- Welcome to '____'
- My name is Adam Giese
- Software engineer full time for five years
- Before that, attended school for music
- Drawn to music theory -- analytical thinking
- When started FP, found same itch scratched
- When started musical project, decided FP

"So, here is my introduction to functional programming â€” from a musical perspective."
```

## What is functional programming?
<Appear>
  Programming with functions!
</Appear>

```notes
- What is functional programming?

- (short pause -- click through)

- It's programming with functions!

- Object oriented based around objects

- 'Functions' are the building block
```

## What is a function?
<Drake
  top1={'A sequence of commands'}
  top2={'abstracted into a reusable unit.'}
  bottom1={'A relationship between a'}
  bottom2={'set of inputs and outputs.'}
/>

---

### 'Pure' functions

<Appear>
  <div>1. Given the same arguments, it will return the same value.</div>
  <div>2. No side effects.</div>
  <div><hr />This makes a function "referentially transparent."</div>
</Appear>

---

TODO: Add 'Gru' meme here
- Learn functional programming
- Remove all side effects
- Program is completely useless
- Program is completely useless?!

<Small>Side effects are not bad, but should be used carefully.</Small>

---

## TODO: Add music examples of "pure" functions

---

# Immutability

<Small>definition: a variable whose state cannot be modified after creation</Small>

---

> "If you have a dollar, and I give you another dollar, it does not change the fact that a moment ago you only had one dollar, and now you have two."
_-Eric Elliott_

---

TODO: advantages of immutability
- "Math" definition (`x = x * 2` is nonsense in math)
- Prevents data loss
- Easier to reason about
- Is "declarative"
- Structural sharing (tries)

---

## Higher order functions

<Small>definition: a function that either accepts a function <br />as an argument or returns a new function</Small>

---
<Dawg
  line1='Yo dawg I heard you like functions so I made a function'
  line2='that takes a function and returns a function'
>
</Dawg>

---
## You may have used a <br />higher order function
<small>(whether you know it or not)</small>
---
```js
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  playMyMusic();
});
```
<Small><code>addEventListener</code> accepts a function as its second argument</Small>
---

```js
/* function that returns music function */
```
---

## Closure
<Small>definition: a function and its access to its enclosed state</Small>

---

```js
/* example of closure */
```

---

### Partial Application
<Small>definition: a technique to "pre-set" some arguments of a function</Small>

```notes
- a type of closure
- incredibly useful for writing reusable, generic functions

```
---
TODO: add example of partial application
---

### Currying
<Small>definition: a technique to take a function with multiple arguments <br /> and return a function that accepts them one at a time</Small>


```notes
- is related to partial application
```
---
TODO: add example of currying

---

## Composition
<Small>TODO: add definition</Small>

```notes
- I like the metaphor of "pipes"
```
