### 'Pure' functions

<Appear>
  <div>1. Given the same arguments, it will return the same value.</div>
  <div>2. No side effects.</div>
  <div><hr />This makes a function "referentially transparent."</div>
</Appear>

```notes
- It should be noted that side effects are _not_ bad.

<small>(whether you know it or not)</small>
